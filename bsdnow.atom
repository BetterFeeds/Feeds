        <summary>This week on the show, we’ll be talking to Petra about the NetBSD foundation &amp; how they operate and
            assist NetBSD behind the scenes. That plus lots of news about the pending 11.0-RELEASE of FreeBSD &amp;
            more! Stay tuned for your place to B...SD!

            &lt;h2&gt;Headlines&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2016-10-03-FreeBSD-EC2-11-0-RELEASE.html&quot;&gt;What
            is new on EC2 for FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE is just around the corner, and it will be bringing a long list of new
            features and improvements — far too many for me to list here. I think there are
            some improvements in FreeBSD 11.0 which are particularly noteworthy for EC2 users.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“First, the EC2 Console Screenshot functionality now works with FreeBSD. This provides a &quot;VGA&quot;
            output as opposed to the traditional &quot;serial port&quot; which EC2 has exposed as
            &quot;console output&quot; for the past decade, and is useful largely because the &quot;VGA&quot; output
            becomes available immediately whereas the &quot;serial port&quot; output can lag by several minutes. This
            improvement is a simple configuration change — older releases didn&#39;t waste time writing to a non-serial
            console because it didn&#39;t go anywhere until Amazon added support on their
            side — and can be enabled on older FreeBSD releases by changing the line console=&quot;comconsole&quot; to
            boot_multicons=&quot;YES&quot; in /boot/loader.conf.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“The second notable change is support for EC2 &quot;Enhanced Networking&quot; using Intel 82599
            hardware; on the C3, C4, R3, I2, D2, and M4 (excluding m4.16xlarge) families, this
            provides increased network throughput and reduced latency and jitter, since it allows FreeBSD to talk
            directly to the networking hardware rather than via a Xen paravirtual interface.
            Getting this working took much longer than I had hoped, but the final problem turned out not to be in
            FreeBSD at all — we were tickling an interrupt-routing bug in a version of
            Xen used in EC2. Unfortunately FreeBSD does not yet have support for the new &quot;Elastic Network Adapter&quot;
            enhanced networking used in P2 and X1 instance families and the m4.16xlarge
            instance type; I&#39;m hoping that we&#39;ll have a driver for that before FreeBSD 11.1 arrives.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“The third notable change is an improvement in EC2 disk throughput. This comes thanks to enabling
            indirect segment I/Os in FreeBSD&#39;s blkfront driver; while the support was
            present in 10.3, I had it turned off by default due to performance anomalies on some EC2 instances. (Those
            EC2 performance problems have been resolved, and disk I/O performance in
            EC2 on FreeBSD 10.3 can now be safely improved by removing the line hw.xbd.xbd&lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt;indirect=&quot;0&quot;
            from /boot/loader.conf.)”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“Finally, FreeBSD now supports all 128 CPUs in the x1.32xlarge instance type. This improvement
            comes thanks to two changes: The FreeBSD default kernel was modified in 2014 to
            support up to 256 CPUs (up from 64), but that resulted in a (fixed-size) section of preallocated memory
            being exhausted early in the boot process on systems with 92 or more CPUs; a
            few months ago I changed that value to tune automatically so that FreeBSD can now boot and not immediately
            panic with an out-of-the-box setup on such large systems.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“I think FreeBSD/EC2 users will be very happy with FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE; but I&#39;d like to end
            with an important reminder: No matter what you might see on FTP servers, in EC2, or
            available via freebsd-update, the new release has not been released until you see a GPG-signed email from
            the release engineer. This is not just a theoretical point: In my time as a
            FreeBSD developer I&#39;ve seen multiple instances of last-minute release re-rolls happening due to problems
            being discovered very late, so the fact that you can see bits doesn&#39;t
            necessarily mean that they are ready to be downloaded. I hope you&#39;re looking forward to 11.0-RELEASE,
            but please be patient.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;hr&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=213196&quot;&gt;Upgrading
            Amazon EC2 instance from 10.3 to 11.0-PRERELEASE results in hang at boot &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;As if to underscore that last point, a last minute bug was found on sunday night&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;A user reported that they used freebsd-update to upgrade an EC2 instance from 10.3 to 11.0 and it
            started hanging during boot&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;After some quick investigation by Colin, the problem was reproduced&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Since I had done a lot of work in the loader recently, I helped Colin build a version of the
            loader with a lot of the debugging enabled, and some more added to try to isolate where
            in the loader the freeze was happening&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Colin and I worked late into the night, but eventually found the read from disk that was causing
            the hang&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Unlike most of the other reads, that were going into the heap, this read was into a very low
            memory address, right near the 640kb border. This initially distracted us from the real
            cause of the problem&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;With more debugging added, it was determined that the problem was in the GELIBoot code, when
            reading the last sector of each partition to determine if it is encrypted. In cases
            where the partition is not 4k aligned, and butts up against the end of the disk, the formula used could
            result in a read past the end of the disk&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The formula rounds the last sector byte address down to the nearest factor of 4096, then reads
            4096 bytes. Then that buffer is examined to determine if the partition is encrypted.
            If it is a 512b sector drive, the metadata will be in the last 512 bytes of that 4096 byte buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;However, if the partition is not 4k aligned, the rounding will produce a value that is less than
            4096 bytes from the end of the disk, and attempting to read 4096 bytes, will read
            past the end of the disk&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Normally this isn’t that big of a problem, the BIOS will just return an error. The loader will
            retry up to three times, then give up and move on, continuing to boot normally.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Some BIOSes are buggy, and will initiate their own retries, and the combination might result in a
            stall of up to 30 seconds for each attempt to read past the end of the disk&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;But it seems that Amazon EC2 instances, (and possibly other virtual instances), will just hang in
            this case.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;This bug has existed for 6 months, but was not caught because almost all installations are 4k
            aligned thanks to changes made to the installer over the last few years, and most
            hardware continues to boot with no sign of a problem&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Even the EC2 snapshot images of 11.0 do not have the problem, as they use a newer disk layout that
            is 4k aligned by default now. The problem only seems to happen when older disk
            images are upgraded&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The fix has been committed and will be merged the the branches over the next few days&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;An Errata notice will be issues, and the fix will be available via freebsd-update&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;It is recommended that EC2 users, and anyone who wants to be especially cautious, wait until this
            errata notice goes out before attempting to upgrade from FreeBSD 10.3 to 11.0&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You can determine if your partitions are 4k aligned by running ‘gpart show’. If there is free
            space after your last partition, you won’t have any issues.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;[What typing ^D really does on Unix&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/TypingEOFEffects)
            + How often have you used a ^D to generate an EOF? Do you really know what that does?
            + Chris Siebenmann has posted a look at this on his blog, which might not be what you think&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“Typing ^D causes the tty driver to immediately finish a read().”&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;He continues on:&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Normally doing a read() from a terminal is line-buffered inside the tty driver; your program only
            wakes up when the tty driver sees the newline, at which point you get back the full
            line. (Note that this buffering is distinct from anything that your language&#39;s IO system may be doing.)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Typing ^D causes the tty driver to stop waiting for a newline and immediately return from the
            read() with however much of the line has been accumulated to date. If you haven&#39;t
            typed anything on the line yet, there is nothing accumulated and the read() will return 0 bytes, which is
            conveniently the signal for end of file. If you have typed something the
            program will get it; because it doesn&#39;t have a trailing newline, the program&#39;s own line-buffering
            may take over and keep read()ing to get the rest of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Other programs will immediately process the partial line with no buffering; cat is one example of
            this.)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve typed ^D on a partial line, that portion of the line is immutable because it&#39;s
            already been given to the program. Most Unixes won&#39;t let you backspace over such partial
            lines; effectively they become output, not input.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Note that modern shells are not good examples of this, because they don&#39;t do line-buffered
            input; to support command line editing, they switch terminal input into an uninterpreted
            mode. So they get the raw ^D and can do whatever they want with it, and they can let you edit as much of the
            pending line as they want.)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Fascinating stuff, and interesting to see behind the curtain at exactly what’s going on with your
            programs buffering and tty driver interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            FreeBSD in Travis-CI Thanks to KQEmu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Travis-CI is the most popular testing framework on Github, but it doesn’t support any of the BSDs&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;This didn’t discourage Even Rouault, who managed to run FreeBSD in KQEMU on the Linux instances
            provided by Travis-CI&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“Travis-CI has a free offer for software having public repository at GitHub. Travis-CI provides
            cloud instances running Linux or Mac OS X. To increase portability tests of
            GDAL, I wondered if it was somehow possible to run another operating system with Travis-CI, for example
            FreeBSD. A search lead me to this
            &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1818&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; in their bug
            tracker but the outcome seems to be that it is not possible, nor in their medium or long term plans.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“One idea that came quickly to mind was to use the QEMU machine emulator that can simulate full
            machines, of several hardware architectures.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;They found an existing image of FreeBSD 9.2 and configured the Travis job to download it and fire
            it up in QEMU.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“Here we go: ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make ! That works, but 50 minutes later (the maximum
            length of a Travis-CI job), our job is killed with perhaps only 10% of the GDAL code base being
            compiled. The reason is that we used the pure software emulation mode of QEMU that involves on-the-fly
            disassembling of the code to be run and re-assembling.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Travis-CI runs in Google Compute Engine, which does not allow nested virtualization, so hardware
            virtualization is not an option to speed up QEMU&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“Here comes the time for good old memories and a bit of software archeology. QEMU was started by
            Fabrice Bellard. If you didn&#39;t know his name yet, F. Bellard created FFMPEG and
            QEMU, holds a world record for the number of decimals of Pi computed on a COTS PC, has ported QEMU in
            JavaScript to run the Linux kernel in your browser, devised BPG, a new
            compression based on HEVC, etc....”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“At the time where his interest was focused on QEMU, he created KQemu, a kernel module (for Linux,
            Windows, FreeBSD hosts), that could significantly enhance QEMU performance
            when the guest and hosts are x86/x86_64 and does not require (nor use) hardware virtualization
            instructions.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“Running it on Travis-CI was successful too, with the compilation being done in 20 minutes, so
            probably half of the speed of bare metal, which is good enough.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;“I could also have potentially tried VirtualBox because, as mentioned above, it supports software
            virtualization with acceleration. But that is only for 32 bit guests (and I
            didn&#39;t find a ready-made FreeBSD 32bit image that you can directly ssh into). For 64 bit guests,
            VirtualBox require hardware virtualization to be available in the host. To the best
            of my knowledge, KQemu is (was) the only solution to enable acceleration of 64 bit guests without hardware
            requirements.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;It will be interesting to see if enough people do this hack, maybe Travis-CI will consider
            properly supporting FreeBSD&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kernelnomicon.org/?p=650&quot;&gt;VirtualBox Shared Folders on FreeBSD:
            progress report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;In the past month or so, VirtualBox in the FreeBSD ports tree got bumped to version 5, which while
            bringing new features, did cause a regression in Shared Folders.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;FreeBSD developer gonzo@ (Oleksandr Tymoshenko) has been tackling this issue in recent days and
            provides us with a look behind the curtain at the challenges involved.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Specifically he started by implementing the various needed VOPs: “lookup, access, readdir, read,
            getattr, readlink, remove, rmdir, symlink, close, create, open, write.”&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;He then continues with details about how complete this is:&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;““Kind of implemented” means that I was able to mount directory, traverse it, read file, calculate
            md5 sums and compare with host’s md5sum, create/remove directories,
            unzip zip file, etc but I doubt it would survive stress-test. Locking is all wrong at the moment and
            read/write VOPs allocate buffers for every operation.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The bigger issue faced is with the rename VOP though:&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I hit a roadblock with rename VOP: it involves some non-trivial locking logic and also there is a
            problem with cached paths. VBox hypervisor operates on full paths so we cache them
            in vboxfs nodes, but if one of parent directories is renamed, all cached names should be modified
            accordingly. I am going to tackle these two problems once I have long enough stretch
            of time time sit and concentrate on task.
            + We wish him luck in getting those issues solved. I know quite a few of our users rely on shared folders as
            well.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
