        <a href="http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/a-prog-by-any-other-name">A 
Prog By Any Other Name</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ted Unangst looks at what goes into the name of a 
program</li>
        <li>“Sometimes two similar programs are really the same 
program with two names. For example, grep and egrep are 
two commands that perform very similar functions and are 
therefore implemented as a single program. Running ls -i 
and observing the inode number of each file will reveal 
that there is only one file. Calling the program egrep 
is a shorthand for -E and does the same thing.”</li>
        <li>So BSD provides __progname in libc, so a program can 
tell what its name is</li>
        <li>But, what if it has more than one name?</li>
        <li>“In fact, every program has three names: its name in 
the filesystem, the name it has been invoked with, and 
whatever it believes its own name to be.”</li>
        <li>Of course it is not that easy. </li>
        <li>“there’s another set of choices for each name, the 
full path and the basename”</li>
        <li>“It’s even possible on some systems for argv[0] to 
be NULL.”</li>
        <li>He then goes on to rename doas (the OpenBSD light 
replacement for sudo) to banana and discuss what 
happens</li>
        <li>“On that note, another possible bug is to realize 
that syslog by default uses progname. A user may be able 
to evade log monitoring by invoking doas with a 
different name. (Just fixed.)”</li>
        <li>Another interesting article from our friend Ted</li>

        <a href="http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/libressl-more-vague-promises">libressl 
- more vague priomises</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We haven’t had a Ted U article on the show as of 
late, however this week we get several! In his next 
entry “LibreSSL, more vague promises”</li>
        <li>He then goes into some detail on what has happened 
with LibreSSL in the past while, as well as future plans 
going forward. </li>
        <li>“With an eye to the future, what new promises can we 
make? Some time ago I joked that we only promised to 
make a better TLS implementation, not a better TLS. 
Remains true, but fortunately there are people working 
on that, too. TLS 1.3 support is on the short term 
watchlist. The good news is we may be ahead of the game, 
having already removed compression. How much more work 
can there be?”</li>
        <li>“LibreSSL integrated the draft chacha20-poly1305 
construction from BoringSSL. The IETF has since 
standardized a slightly different version because if it 
were the same it wouldn’t be different. Support for 
standard variant, and the beginning of deprecation for 
the existing code, should be landing very shortly. 
Incidentally, some people got bent out of shape because 
shipping chacha20 meant exposing non IANA approved 
numbers to Internet. No promises that won’t happen 
again.”</li>

        <li>OpenBSD was the first implementation, most others 
have been unmaintained for some time</li>

      <ul>
        <li>After 15 years, Larry the BSD Guy has decided to 
hang it up, and walk into the sunset! (Figuratively of 
course)</li>
        <li>After wrapping up coverage of recent LinuxFest 
NorthWest (Which he didn’t attend), Larry has decided 
it’s time for a change and is giving up his column over 
at FOSS Force, as well as stepping away from all things 
technical. </li>
        <li>His last write-up is a good one, and he has some 
nice plugs for both Dru Lavigne and Michael Dexter of 
the BSD community. </li>
        <li>He will be missed, but we wish him all the luck with 
the future! He also puts out the plug that FOSS Force 
will be needing a new columnist in the near future, so 
if you are interested please let them know!</li>
